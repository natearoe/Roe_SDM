# Roe_SDM
This repository contains the materials for reproducing the data analysis in Roe et al. (2021) published in the Journal of Biogeography. 

Raw data will be accessible through Dryad, as preferred by JBI. A link to the Dryad materials will be added here once the manuscript has been accepted by JBI and data are uploaded. 

This dataset uses long-term monitoring plots. To protect the integrity of these plots, location data will not be shared. 

If you have any questions, please contact Nathan Roe - nateroe@gmail.com
